# Overview of Analysis

We have been tasked with assisting our clients convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Task Items

•	Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

•	Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

•	Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Resources
-	Python
-	Tableau
-	Citi Bike trip history data
